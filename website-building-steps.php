                           <p>The first step is to ask all necessary questions and gather all information including scope and requirements pertaining to the project. We find out the general look and audience the site or application will target. Domain name and Hosting requirements are set in place. Then it’s pages , page hierarchy, functionality, self editable features and intended presence on cross platform devices are outlined.</p>

                           <h2>Mock ups</h2>
                           <p>We create wire-frame mock-ups that best conceptualize your project’s road map. This involves the laying out of simple boxes and placeholder text to present in multiple static images. Wire frames help give an idea of the overall site structure, placement of important elements and navigation that will occur in the final product. Navigation scheme, data tables, forms, image galleries and other features are also decided upon. If applicable, the frameworks&nbsp;are chosen and approved of. (this step may be skipped for less complicated projects)</p>

                           <p>The look, feel, direction of the entire site is established for early approval based on information gathered from step 1 and 2. Photography, content, and graphics are ideally gathered beforehand but placeholder text and imagery substitution may occur if the client needs more time for their content, photography, etc to arrive. Colours, fonts, textures and graphics are also finalized and approved.</p>

With the assistance of a quality assurance team we test to make sure things run smoothly on all platforms and browsers and work out any bugs.</p>

The URL is submitted to search engines and directories and any promotional activities outlined in the estimate take place. We will also train your staff to use the site&nbsp;at this time.</p>
