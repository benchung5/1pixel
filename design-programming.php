                     <h2>We enjoy the challenges of design and programming and handle all&nbsp;ends of the spectrum. Whether making slider graphics or pulling in real-time data to your website , we take projects from beginning to end without leaving our circle of expertise.</h2>

                        <h2>Design</h2>
                        <p>Our design team is responsible for creating quality graphics and a professional look and feel to our projects. We design with crisp 2 dimensional design aesthetics on par with the fundamentals of Web 3.0 mobile apps and modern responsive sites. Throughout creation we pay special attention the the style that the client is looking for as well as the message and marketing strategy that they intend to convey. In short, our interest and intention is to use look and feel to reach out the the audience at hand.</p>

                        <h2>Programming</h2>
                        <p>Our programming toolkit include languages like PHP, SQL and Javascript. We’ve used others in the past like C# and Asp.net but have since narrowed our focus to open source Node.js, PHP and ReactJS related frameworks. We code with the latest CSS3 and HTML 5 web standards and make sure we’re as W3C compliant as possible. We keep modularity and flexibility in mind and are sure to ask our clients about their plans for future expansion so their software can smoothly accommodate it.</p>

                        <h3>Doing it right</h3>
                        <p>There’s a big difference between building a website and building one properly. Our Node apps are built to be scalable to handle the demands of high traffic and bandwidth while keeping a slick and desktop-like user interaction. In the WordPress administration area, we take care of the scary stuff and have our clients optionally take care of the less intimidating things. All of our sites use real text and CSS where possible for maximum search results and edit-ability. No sliced images for body text and image files are kept in layers where possible to ensure easy updates to graphics down the road.</p>
                        <p>All sites and apps are hosted on the cloud, tested and optimized. With monthly maintenance plans, we can ensure your apps continue to run smoothly and on the ball&nbsp;with critical updates.</p>
                        <p>The above are just a few&nbsp;standards we go by. In short, quality craftsmanship and longevity are the two biggest benchmarks we think about when we go about doing our building.</p>
